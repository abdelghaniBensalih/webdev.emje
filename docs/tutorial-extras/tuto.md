## How to Make a Delicious Omelet üç≥

Welcome, EMJE members! As we dive into our projects and collaborations, let's take a moment to appreciate the simplicity and satisfaction of making a perfect omelet‚Äîan easy meal to keep you energized!

### Ingredients

- 2-3 eggs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Butter or oil
- Your favorite fillings (cheese, vegetables, herbs, etc.)

### Instructions

1. **Prep Your Ingredients**: Gather your eggs and any fillings you‚Äôd like to include. Common options are cheese, bell peppers, onions, and spinach. Chop them up and set them aside.

2. **Whisk the Eggs**: Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until the yolks and whites are well combined. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.

3. **Heat the Pan**: In a non-stick skillet, melt a small amount of butter or heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Make sure it coats the bottom of the pan evenly.

4. **Cook the Eggs**: Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Let them sit for a moment until the edges start to set. Using a spatula, gently push the cooked edges toward the center while tilting the pan to allow uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.

5. **Add Fillings**: When the top is still slightly runny but mostly set, sprinkle your desired fillings over one half of the omelet.

6. **Fold and Serve**: Carefully fold the omelet in half using the spatula. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate. Enjoy your omelet hot!

### Final Thoughts

Cooking together can be a fun and creative way to bond as a team. Let‚Äôs bring the same energy we put into our omelets into our projects at EMJE!

Bon app√©tit! üç≥‚ú®
